## Testing HTTPS with pord environment variable set
21:24:28.002 INFO  [restartedMain] c.e.EasyBankBackendApplication - **The following 1 profile is active: "prod"**

**My browser:** 
Redirects me to https://localhost:8443/myAccount?continue with an message about unavailability.

**Postman:**

### solution
We start the application with non-prod profile.


## Testing CustomBasicAuthenticationEntryPoint customised error header

Postman:
GET http://localhost:8080/myAccount
response body: 
{"timestamp":"2025-04-15T13:44:49.628+00:00","status":401,"error":"Unauthorized","message":"Unauthorized","path":"/myAccount"}

And we can see header: 
Response Headers
eazybank-error-reason: Authentication failed
...


## Testing CustomBasicAuthenticationEntryPoint customised error message

Postman:
GET http://localhost:8080/myAccount
{"timestamp":"2025-04-15T16:15:18.705367700","status":401,"error":"Unauthorized","message":"User not found for the username: smith@example.com1","path":"/myAccount"}


## Testing CustomAccessDeniedHandler

Postman:
GET http://localhost:8080/myAccount1    //wrong address
{"timestamp":"2025-04-15T19:34:29.900786600","status":403,"error":"Forbidden","message":"Access Denied","path":"/myAccount1"}

and one of response headers:
eazybank-denied-reason: Authorization failed


The lecturer got the same JSON in hos browser. 
I'm getting some error page translated to czech. This might be some browser setting.
I tried to set an breakpoint in the CustomAccessDeniedHandler and it sent the JSON right.


## Session Timeout

After the session expires, the browser redirects to the login page.

### invalid session page
Now we get 404 in the browser after the timeout, because we did not build the /invalidSession page.
But the value in the address bar is: http://localhost:8080/invalidSession

### Browser refresh attempt (user was logged in before)
Request headers:
GET /myAccount HTTP/1.1

Cookie: JSESSIONID=053E977CE9459B78C5086551E2ECD1A2

Response headers:

X-Frame-Options: DENY
...

Response:
**This session has been expired (possibly due to multiple concurrent logins being attempted as the same user).**

This was a bit strange, because the lecturer achieved this in the Postman while I did in the browser.
I could not achieve the session expired message in the Postman.
